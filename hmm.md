Game mechanics:
-

Base mechanics:

there will be something like "time_fluid"

it's concentration in the player blood will be shown as a bar

after killing certain types of mobs and bosses the concentration will increase

amount gained by killing mobs and bosses will increase as the player levels up

the capacity of the blood to hold this fluid will also increase by using it many times

increased capacity will be shown as >%100

if the concentration reaches 100% then player will get some buffs

but if held 100% concentration for too long around 10min then it would kill the player

Time travel:

player can travel time only through mirrors (will come up with a good reason later)

time traveling will be possible only when the concentration of the of the fuild is above a certain mark like 80%

it will consume around 80% of the concentration and being in timelines other than the present time will consume some fluid

and if player runs out of it in other timeline then player will start ageing if in future or growing younger if in past for some buffer time 

if under this time the player doesn't replenish the fluid then the player will die

Skill:

every skill will consume some amount of time fluid

the more advanced a skill the more fluid it will consume

upgrading the skills will make them use less fluid and cause more damage or increase its duration
